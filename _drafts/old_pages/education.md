A continuation of work from Part II ([see below](#mchem-chemistry-2014)), this project refined the demonstrated concept for use with real-world data, including incorporation of several sources of information into one model.

</summary><blockquote class="trimb">
(A proposed research direction)

Using non-Euclidean surfaces, a 3D crystal can be unwrapped into 2D. Rewrapping another way gives a different crystal, thus relating structures that would otherwise be distinct.

Other coordinate transforms interchange angles and distances, resulting in a range of imaginary structures, some of which are more interpretable than the physical one.

</summary><blockquote class="trimb" markdown="block">

<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1em;" markdown="span">*A Bayesian Total Scattering Route to Membrane Protein Structure*</p>

Development of a Bayesian Monte Carlo procedure for ascertaining the fold of proteins in aqueous environments. The key research question was "can we compensate for the orientational disorder of total scattering information by including prior knowledge from other sources?".

This work was awarded the Part II Thesis Prize.
