## What is this word, "Bayesian"?
It refers to a worldview in which **beliefs** are probabilities, and they **evolve** when new evidence is supplied.

As Bayesians, we can combine pre-existing knowledge and supporting evidence from multiple sources without having to build an independent case anew from each.

### Bayes' theorem
Thomas Bayes' posthumously published manuscript of 1764 supplied a formula for this process:

$$ P(A\,|\,B\kern2mu) \;=\; \frac{P(B\,|\,A\kern2mu) \,\cdot\, P(A\kern2mu)}{P(B\kern2mu)} $$


I prefer to use more meaningful letters:  
<br />
$$\qquad P(\mathsf{conclusion}\ C\,\vert\,\mathsf{evidence}\ E\kern2mu)_\alpha \;=\; \displaystyle{\frac{P(E\,\vert\,C\kern2mu)_\alpha\,\cdot\, P(C\kern2mu)_\alpha}{P(E\kern2mu)_\alpha}} $$
<br /><br />
A vertical bar $$\vert$$ is read as "given". Thus $$P(C\,\vert\,E\kern2mu)$$ is "the probability of [*a*] conclusion given [*a piece of*] evidence". And subscript $$ \alpha $$ keeps track of any assumptions and previous findings.
{: .notice--primary}

Using this equation, a **prior** belief about a conclusion gets updated into a **posterior** belief after seeing some evidence. Depending on the relative strengths of prior belief and evidence, the belief may or may not change much.

### Familiar examples
Two corollaries of a Bayesian mindset are **Occam's razor** ("all things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones") and the **Sagan standard** ("extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"). Here are some more specific instances of Bayesian thinking:

## What's so great about mathematical thinking?
In short, it is powerful, constructive, and gratifying.

A training in mathematics is a training in how to see possibility, how to navigate difficulty, how to communicate precisely, how to fail usefully, and how to find beauty in strange places. These skills are as worthwhile outside maths as in it.

### Problems
Mathematics is the art of expressing **truths**: either to formalize known ones or to reach new ones. By dealing with truth through mathematical reasoning (rather than scientific experiment), there is nowhere to hide. Nothing is omitted when describing a problem, and nothing more is assumed when attempting it. A proof leads its reader to a necessary conclusion, but makes no further claim.

This is problem solving at its purest, and it demands a comprehensive approach. To be successful, a mathematician must answer questions like:
- What is the essence of this problem?
- Can it be done?
- What does success look like?
- What would help me reach a solution?
- Where would I find similar *solved* problems?

In my view there is no better arena to highlight the importance of care, rigour, persistence, and open-mindedness in problem-solving than mathematics, because failure here is usually attributable to a lack of these traits.

But solving is just one side of the coin. Study of mathematics also hones one's ability to ask the right **questions**.

Most maths leads to uninteresting truths (if it leads anywhere at all): things like "$$N$$ is a factor of $$N\kern2mu$$". Statements like these are either too specific or too general to be of any use, so it is a vital mathematical skill to find the problems that have solutions worth finding.

Likewise, some problems are so hard that they take many decades to overcome. Canny mathematicians know their limits...

<a name="humanizing"></a>
## Why is humanizing important to you?
Because it's easy to forget that we are human, and among humans.

This is somewhat inevitable: for much of our existence we're encouraged to think of ourselves as 'do-ers' and 'have-ers' rather than '**be**-ers'. After all, 'being' has no purpose, so how can we form an identity on it?

But this amounts to dehumanization.

### Humans doing
A dehumanized person is more predictable and convenient to deal with, so we act (and expect others to act) like we aren't complex, passion-driven creatures. Instead we are our jobs, our status, our brand, our legacy, our possessions, and our habits.

I believe this position is catastrophically bad. Not just "what a shame", but physically, existentially threatening.

When we measure a society's success by things like GDP, employment rate, or research output, we fail to capture any fundamental human **needs** (food, shelter, affection, self-fulfilment *etc.*); when we measure a company's success by profit, market share, or patents, these similarly miss the point. And when *people* identify as parts of these systems rather than as loving, living organisms, the result is a world where human activity acts **against human interests**.

Sometimes this is quite transparent, like the CEO who exploits a desperate workforce for personal gain. But more often, it sneaks up on us in the form of temptingly simple ideologies:
- "Economic growth is the engine behind quality-of-life improvement."
- "This industry employs tens of thousands so it needs protection."
- "Technological progress will lead us into a better future."

Dehumanization of people into do-ers is responsible for the worst ills of society, from climate change to extreme wealth inequality. But it can be combatted on a daily basis by **humanizing**: proactively considering human needs.

### Human beings
Any time we need to treat a human as a do-er, we can make a conscious effort to recognize their whole being as well. This means a baseline of respect and empathy, of course, but also challenging the assumptions that led to the 'do-er' view in the first place.

For example, talking about "cyclists" may involve discussion of their safety, their behaviour, and the infrastructure they use, but it should also provoke questions about **who** they are and **why** they cycle. Do the answers change our perspective? Do they highlight something that might improve the overall human experience?

Alternatively, a "project manager" is a useful commercial role, but who performs it – and why? How does it affect other people? Can they be supported in any way to get the best experience for everyone? What happens to these people when things don't go to plan?

When we reflect on the human stake in human activity, we avoid discarding it. Dehumanization doesn't always look like wilful oppression; from time to time we all pretend that other people are 'NPCs' (non-player characters), especially if we've never even seen them. But remembering each other's humanity at the small scale will contribute to larger-scale attitudes and a world that better serves our needs.
