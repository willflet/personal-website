### Who are you?

I'm this guy:

![Picture of Will](/assets/images/portrait.jpg){: .align-center .framed style="width: 300px;"}

I live in London, and I'm mostly unremarkable.

### How would you describe yourself?

To give a quick impression, I'm an [ex-academic](/about/education/) who works with artificial intelligence techniques -- primarily machine learning. I can [talk to computers](/about/skills/) with relative ease.

Some characteristics I like in myself are [mathematical thinking](/faq/#mathematical-thinking), love of learning, a [humanizing](/faq/#humanizing) instinct, and undiluted whimsy. These direct my everyday decisions, and I try to encourage and foster such qualities in others as well. I like doing things with people: above all, I enjoy helping them to succeed and be happy. I try to style myself as approachable, available, and open.

### What's your story?

I grew up in and around Oxford and Cambridge, in unstable but largely privileged circumstances.

As a teenager in Cambridge, my life was dominated by music and church. Although this is a past that won't be reproduced, I still identify as musical, and my oldest friendships grew out of the church youth group.

At school I took A-levels in Music, Chemistry, Maths and Further Maths.

I then studied [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk) at Oxford, completing an MChem in 2014. I specialized at the mathematical end of the subject, with my final year spent on a computational project in a [crystallography group](https://goodwingroup.wordpress.com). I stayed for a further 2 years as a PhD student, holding teaching positions alongside my research.

As time went by, I fell out of love with the idea of being a chemist and tried to pivot even harder towards maths, hoping my patchy experience would hold up. I left my PhD unfinished, and took an MSc in [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk) at UCL, which I finished in 2017.

Since then I've been plying the startup scene of London, continuously learning and re-moulding myself into something worthwhile. What does my future hold? Who knows, but I will apply whatever influence I can towards a better future for all of us.
