##### Data and Information
People tend to describe someone
like me as a "data scientist". *Data science* is a nebulous term that's not heavily used in academia (unlike
*materials science* or *computer science*), and for good reasons. But over time,
a definition has more or less settled:

> **Data science is a set of practices
concerning the generation of knowledge from data.**

To be a proficient data scientist, one must

- Identify what knowledge is needed
- Find data sources that may yield this knowledge
- Manipulate and combine data sources to increase the potential knowledge yield
- Extract the knowledge from the data
- Communicate and consolidate the knowledge in useful ways


In contrast to most science, we are unambitious in our statements about the data
itself, learning very little *universal* knowledge. Instead, the focus is on the techniques used. Advances in
data science are all methodological, at least for now.

Methodology is a distraction from the prefer to focus on the about information (and data merely as a carrier),
which is and all the ways we
capture, communicate and interpret it.
