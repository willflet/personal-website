### What's your relationship with machine learning?




### What do you believe in?

I am a proponent of all action against [entropy](/entropy/), and argue that
thoughtfulness, design, and deliberate choice lead to less entropy than
intuition, imitation and arbitrary choice.

I am a proud Bayesian, and was since my very first computational project
-- using a Monte Carlo [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Monte_Carlo)
to fold proteins. To a Bayesian, nothing is certain, but everything informs.

I love to teach, to learn, to discover new perspectives, to help, and to affect
the world in a positive way.
